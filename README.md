## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the major things I struggled with in this project was positioning the logos and other images, and making them responsive as well.  At first I put them in using 'background-image' properties, but realized that this way I didn't have a lot of control over how the images would behave when the screen size changed.  I then hard-coded them in as individual <img> elements, giving me a lot more control over the images and their responsiveness.

I used flexbox extensively in this project and relied on it heavily for the changes that occur with smaller screen-sizes (e.g. switching from a 'row' orientation to a 'column' orientation with smaller screens).  

This project featured a lot of cool hover effects as well, and made me really think about how to change elements and give them different states when necessary.
